# **App Name**: EdFlex Exam Builder

## Core Features:

- Question Browser: Interactive question browser, allowing teachers to browse available questions based on metadata tags like subject, topic, class and difficulty level.
- Exam Builder: Drag-and-drop exam builder interface: Provides an interface for teachers to create custom exams by dragging and dropping individual questions or pre-existing question sets onto a virtual exam canvas.
- Question Set Editor: Support creation and editing of pre-defined fixed question sets in order to ensure that past evaluation exercises can be replicated for longitudinal study of learning.
- Advanced Filters: Metadata filtering, with a type-ahead to help the instructor find the tag of their choice: Allow teachers to filter and search questions by class, subject, program, topic, difficulty, and other relevant attributes using faceted search.
- Content Recommendations: Exam preview and validation: The tool pre-views an automatically assembled summary table that shows question difficulty, Bloom's taxonomy type, and any content gaps in order to make recommendations.
- AI Question Suggestion: AI-powered question suggestion, using an LLM tool to suggest a balanced question set according to user-defined parameters (e.g., topic, Bloom's taxonomy)
- Local Storage Persistance: The tool tracks each exam that's been generated by storing data in the user's local storage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A085CF) for a sophisticated educational feel.
- Background color: Light lavender (#F2F0FA), desaturated for ease of viewing.
- Accent color: Muted teal (#73A7AD) for interactive elements and highlights, for calm contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, is recommended for its modern, objective look suitable for both headlines and body text.
- Use clear, consistent icons to represent different question types, subjects, and actions (e.g., edit, delete, add). Favor outline icons for a modern, lightweight feel.
- A clean, intuitive layout that emphasizes drag-and-drop functionality, filtering and metadata clearly on the side.
- Use subtle animations to enhance user interactions, such as highlighting questions when dragging and dropping, and providing feedback on actions (e.g., saving, deleting).
